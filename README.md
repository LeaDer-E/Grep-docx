# Grep-docx
A powerful and user-friendly Python script that recursively searches all `.docx` files in your project directory (and subdirectories), looking for a specific keyword or phrase. Inspired by Linux's `grep` command, but tailored for Microsoft Word documents and enhanced with colored, structured terminal output.
